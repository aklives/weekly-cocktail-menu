# weekly-cocktail-menu
add cocktails to daily cocktail menu

This program gives you a list of days of the week. Clicking on a day will present a list of cocktails being served that day. 
You can add a cocktail to a certain day, or delete a cocktail from a day.

To install, clone this repo, then in the backend folder run bundle install, rails db:create, rails db:migrate, rails db:seed, 
and rails server.  In the frontend folder, open index.html in your browser.  The JavaScript file will fetch information
from the Ruby on Rails backend API, manipulating the Document Object Model to render items on the page without refreshing.

Feel free to use for informational purposes.
